**Zero-day vulnerabilities** are security flaws in software or hardware that are unknown to the party responsible for patching or fixing the vulnerability. 
By definition, these vulnerabilities are discovered by malicious actors, [white hat][1] researchers, or third parties, but there's essentially “zero days” 
for the vendor to fix them before they can be exploited.[^1]

## Why Zero-Days Matter

Zero-day exploits can have catastrophic consequences, including data breaches, system compromises, and infiltration by advanced persistent threats (APTs). 
Attackers that utilize zero-day exploits tend to be well-funded (such as nation-state threat actors), but not always.[^2]

## Prevention & Mitigation

1. **Frequent System Updates**  
   Regularly patching known vulnerabilities reduces the overall attack surface—even if a zero-day initially slips through.
2. **Advanced Intrusion Detection**  
   Suspicious behavior or anomalies can sometimes be caught, even if the exploit is unknown.
3. **Threat Intelligence**  
   Monitoring threat intelligence feeds helps security teams respond more quickly when new exploits emerge.

[^1]: “Zero day” means there’s effectively no time between the discovery and initial exploitation.
[^2]: Some zero-days are discovered and sold on the black market, making them accessible to lower-level cybercriminals who have enough money to purchase them.
