# Tufte CSS Test Post

Welcome to a quick test of **Tufte CSS** margin notes and sidenotes on a wide screen! Resize your browser to see how they behave.

## Sidenote Example

Here's some text.  
<label for="sn-example" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-example" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">
  This is a sidenote. On wide screens, it floats in the right margin. 
  On narrow screens, you tap/click the footnote number to toggle it.
</span>

Keep in mind that Tufte’s design places notes in the margin if there's enough horizontal space. 
On phones or small widths, they’re hidden until triggered.

## Margin Note Example

Margin notes are like sidenotes, **but** they don't have a footnote number. 
They typically have a plus sign <code>+</code> toggle on narrow screens.

<label for="mn-why-margin" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-why-margin" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="marginnote">
  This is a margin note with no numbered reference. 
  On wide screens, it appears in the margin with no superscript.
</span>

## Extra Check

When you scroll on wide screens, notes should remain aligned with the text. 
Make sure nothing is cut off or hidden. If the notes vanish or overflow, 
verify there's no <code>overflow: hidden;</code> set in your layout.

**Happy testing!**
